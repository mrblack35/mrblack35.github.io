                <p class="main-text">
                    <p>Hi, my name is Kevin Blackwell. I’m a hardworking and confident individual with a wealth of experience working with data and managing teams to complete multiple projects.</p>
                    <p>When I’m not handling data, I like to keep fit and challenge myself, playing mixed doubles in my local badminton club. I’m also really excited to be a member of the volunteer marshals club. As a fan of Motorsport, it will give me the opportunity to get closer to the action.</p>
                    <p>My earliest experience of coding was at a young age, learning to code a basic game. Having the ability to see the result of my hard work was amazing. 
                    <br>Later, while studying graphic design, I was fascinated with the idea of building interactivity into my projects, but the opportunity wasn’t there at the time. It wasn’t until I started working with data in my current role, that I really got the chance to use my logical and problem-solving skills to create solutions to technical problems, using code.</p>
                    <p>In the future I plan to develop my knowledge of back-end processes, with the aim of becoming a full-stack developer. Later I would like to bring my knowledge of managing staff to help nurture teams and grow the company. Also being visually creative I can bring my skills and knowledge to projects, to further enhance collaborations with designers or photographers.</p>
